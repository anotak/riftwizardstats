# Rift Wizard Stats

Currently-very-rough command line statistics generator for the game [Rift Wizard](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1271280/Rift_Wizard/). Takes 1 argument: your rift wizard save folder.

if you want to have its output go to a file, redirect it like so:
`riftwizardstats C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Rift Wizard\RiftWizard\saves\ > output.txt`

# Compilation instructions

Once you have cloned the repository, if you do not have Rust installed, install Rust, and then simply do `cargo build` to build.
